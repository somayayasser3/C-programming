# programming
in this section, there are problems I had solved in C++ like connect four game, calculator, currency converter.

problem 1:-
Develop a calculator program which runs continually and first will ask the user " Would 
you like to close the calculator? " if the user type "yes" the program will end, else it will 
take the operator then two numbers , and print the result depending on the type of the 
operator. (Note that in division you need to handle the division by zero).

problem 2:-
Develop an application that helps us to convert between different currencies. We will 
assume that the base currency is EGP so this program will help us to convert between 
EGP and any other currency and vice versa. 

problem 3:-
Write a program that should accept number of levels and draw a triangle with 90 degrees

problem 4:-
Write a program that runs forever and takes 2 numbers (a, b) then computes a power b 
(a^b). If the user wants to exit the program, he should press 'E'. (Note: Don't use the built 
in function) 


problem 5:-
Write a program that takes number of term in the Fibonacci series and display its value.
Each Fibonacci number is the sum of its two predecessors. The first two Fibonacci 
numbers are 1 and 1. 
 
 problem 6:-
 Write a program that takes a number N and computes it's factorial N!.



problem 7:-
Write a program to check whether an integer (entered by the user) is a prime number or 
not.


problem 8:-
Write a program to print the prime numbers less than 100.

problem 9:-
Write a program that takes an integer number from the user and print it's reverse.

problem 10:-
Write a program that takes an integer number from the user and checks whether the 
number is odd or even.


problem 11:-
- Write a program that takes a letter from the user and checks whether this letter is vowel or 
consonant.


problem 12:-
 Write a program that takes a string and checks if it is palindrome or not. A palindrome is 
any "word" which is the same forward and backward, eg, "radar", "noon", "20011002"

problem 13:-
Write a program that takes an amount of money in Egyptian Pounds and display how 
many ( 100, 50, 10 and 1) pounds exists. 


problem 14:-
Write a function that takes two numbers and return the maximum of the two numbers.



problem 15:-
Write a function that calculates electricity bill given these rules:
Electricity bill is divided into levels of consumption as follows:
- Less than 50 KW, each KW will be calculated with 13 pt.
- Less than 100 KW, each KW is 22 pt.
- Less than 200 KW, each KW is 27 pt.
- Less than 350 KW, each KW is 55 pt.
- Less than 650 KW, each KW is 75 pt.
- Less than 1000 KW, each KW is 125 pt.
- Bigger than that, each KW is 135 pt.


problem 16:-
Write a function that computes sin of x, take value of x and number n (the number that 
itâ€™ll stops at). And prints value of sin x.
Hint: using following formula (called Maclaurin series)

problem 17:-
Write a function that should take number n and prints an empty square

problem 18:-
Write a function that should accept number of levels (till 5) and draw a triangle with 60 degrees

problem 19:-
Write a function that get sum and average of a 1d-array.

problem 20:-
Write a function to get minimum and maximum within a 1d-array.

problem 21:-
Write a function that takes two values and then swap them and print result

problem 21:-
Write a function that takes an array size and inside takes an array and takes a value. If the 
value is found it returns the index. If not it returns -1.

problem 22:-
Write a function that takes 2 arrays (each one of size 5). And print an array sum of each 
element in 2 arrays.

problem 23:-
Write a function that takes an array (of size 5) as an input and output the arrays reversed.

problem 24:-
Write a function that get sum from number m to number n recursively (where m<n).

problem 25:-
Write a function that takes an integer and print values from 1 to n in triangle shape 
recursively.


problem 26:-
create struct object that had info about students and implement some functions about this students database

problem 27:-
build connect four game with 6 rows and 7 cols 

problem 28:-
bulid connect four game with generalized dimensions by the user
